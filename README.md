# Online-Chat-And-File-Sharing
In this project, we have created a web-application wherein we create a student portal for the
students of VIT. Using this online portal, the students can interact with others by forming groups
based on their interests and allowing the other students to join them. Individual students would
be required to create an account to access the features of this portal which shall be managed by
the group administrator who in this case is the creator of the group as well. Thereafter, every
time a student logs in to the portal, it will be using their own user id and password. The groups
consist of discussion forums wherein students shall post some topics of discussion and the
fellow students could like, comment or share the same in order to indulge in the interaction.
Groups shall also comprise of real time chatting facility wherein all the students belonging to a
particular group shall be able to communicate with each other in a single chat window. In
addition to this, the group members shall be entitled to share among themselves different types
of files including text, links and images. Although, every group member shall be entitled to
invite any individual into the group, the member rights would remain solely with the
administrator. The administrator, however, can be altered in case they would like to hand over
the group administration to another member of the group. The application would, at every time,
shall be displaying whether an individual is online by a green mark and also the total number of
students online at a particular time. The profile of each user shall be managed efficiently and
shall be assigned a public username, a profile picture and an optional biography.
